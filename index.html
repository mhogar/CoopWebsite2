  		      This website is about my (Ryan Stamp's) second co-op work term: the company, my experience on the job, and most importantly, the goals I had going in and the skills I took away. By reading this website, I hope you, the reader, learn something about my experience at Tulip, and hopefully even get inspired to figure out what you might want to take away from your future endeavors.

            Tulip Retail is a company that makes a mobile app for in-store associates. These associates can use this app to improve the retail experience. Some features of the app include access the catalog of products, performing remote checkout, ordering a product not currently in the store, and enabling the use of clienteling features, features that allow for better customer connections. Many of Tulip's clients are in the luxury market, with some examples being Michael Kors, Coach, Chanel, and Estee Lauder.

          <span class="sub_section_header">Culture and People</span>
          <p>
            Overall Tulip has a fantastic culture and atmosphere. The employees have very friendly and welcoming personalities, creating more of a "family" vibe than a "co-worker" vibe. Tulip also has various "well being" events, such as holiday parties and hack days. These help to balance out the stress of day to day work and refresh. Weekly and bi-weekly Tulip will have company-wide meetings and product demos that allow different employees and departments to see what other people are up to. I really enjoyed these as they are often informative and allow the company to feel more like a whole.

          <p>
            My job at Tulip consisted mostly of feature development. I was part of the clienteling team and mainly worked on the backend API for upcoming features. This would include creating new database migrations and API endpoints.

          <span class="sub_section_header">Required Skills</span>
          <p>
            Overall, I fell not a lot of required skills were needed, but some basic knowledge is welcome. Prior experience with writing endpoints and migrations are not a requirement, however, it helps to have some knowledge of how databases and endpoints work from an abstract level. Of course, a general knowledge of coding is required, but no specific languages. I knew nothing of PHP before I started, even though it was the language I worked with 90% of the time. Many of the specific skills such as languages and frameworks can be learned on the job.

          <span class="sub_section_header">Learning Goal 1</span>
          <p>
            My first goal of this work term was to learn to use the source control tool Git. I had a similar goal to this last work term that I was not able to complete the level that I would have wished, so I made sure to go out of my way to become more familiar with Git as a whole and not just my daily used features. Not only did I become familiar with Git's more common features, those being committing, pushing, pulling, cloning, etc., but I also learned some of the less used ones, for example stashing, blaming, reverting, and even applying a particular commit. Although Tulip's frequent use of Git was the main inspiration of this goal, Git is also one of the most popular and common source control tools and having experience and knowledge of it will be a great asset for future careers, not just at Tulip.

          <span class="sub_section_header">Learning Goal 2</span>
          <p>
            My second goal was to gain more experience with JavaScript and to learn how to build web APIs. However, during the work term, the feature development changed direction and we started devolving the UI natively for IOS instead of using web views. This limited my opportunities to develop in JavaScript and therefore I was not able to learn it to the level I had planned. I still fixed many bugs in existing web views, so I did get some more experience with reading and debugging, but not much with coding in it. This wasn't a total loss as less front-end work resulted in me getting much more experience with the back-end, the other half of my goal. I successfully wrote the API for 3 features, each involving the creation of new REST endpoints and database migrations. I gained experience with common web API concepts and structures such as CRUD operations, controllers, and models. As web APIs are becoming increasingly more common in the industry, gaining this knowledge and experience with them will be a great asset moving forward.

          <span class="sub_section_header">Learning Goal 3</span>
          <p>
            My third goal for this work term was to learn the process of creating a new feature from a design specification. Through the 3 main features I worked on, each varying in size and complexity, I learned a great deal about the planning process that goes into every feature. Primarily, I learned how to use user stories and tasks to plan out the work. Not only did this allow others to see my progress, but it helped me to focus on one task at a time and prevent me from getting overwhelmed. Although my overall productivity on each feature is hard to compare, I can confidently say that my ability to apply the planning tools did improve over the course of the work term. Since being able to produce what is requested is the foundation of any job, having strong planning skills will no doubt be useful.
          </p>
          <span class="sub_section_header">Learning Goal 4</span>
          <p>
            My fourth and final goal for this work term was to improve my communication skills and teamwork. As someone who is little on the shy side, it is important that I strike a balance between my personality and effective communication. At the end of my work term, I can say that I completed my goal to decent success. Whenever I encountered work I required assistance with I would always reach out in our chat tool MasterMost's help channel. I also became more confident in communicating with my team and speaking up in meetings. I was not afraid to add my own opinions or suggest improvements to other people's ideas. However, I still feel there is room for improvement; this is something that will improve with time and I will continue to work on this in future work terms.

            Overall, Tulip was another great experience. As my second work term, I was pleasantly surprised at how much there is still to learn. This work term taught me just how different two companies can be in the technology they use and the conventions they follow. That's why it's important to keep setting goals and learning new skills that will be useful in the future, not just the present. I will continue to grow as a developer and my experience at Tulip will in no doubt help me in doing so.
